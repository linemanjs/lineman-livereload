# lineman-livereload

This is a plugin to make it easy to use [Livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) via `grunt-contrib-watch` in conjunction with a
[Lineman](http://linemanjs.com) app.

## Usage

**UNPUBLISHED**: This plugin is a work in progress based on work in this PR: https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman/pull/234, as such it should not be used.

If you want a test repo that points to the branch you can try out https://github.com/davemo/lineman-livereload-testing

By default this configures livereload to work with .coffee, .js, .less, and .scss files.
